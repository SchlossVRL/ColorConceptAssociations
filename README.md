### Data files

CATEGORY LEARNING: 

`Exp1-catLearning` & `Exp2-catLearning`: store the alien category learning data for each experiment. Columns for each include: 
- `Subj`: participant number 
- `Condition`: order/pairing of VR/PC & visual/auditory test
      - 2DV3DA = Visual system on PC then auditory system in VR
      - 3DV2DA = Visual system in VR then auditory system on PC 
      - 2DA3DV = Auditory system on PC then visual system in VR
      - 3DA2DV = Auditory system in VR then visual system on PC


ASSOCIATION RATINGS: 

`Exp1-associations` & `Exp2-associations`: store the association rating data for each experiment. Columns for each include: 
- `Subj`: participant number 
- `Condition`: order/pairing of VR/PC & visual/auditory test
      - 2DV3DA = Visual system on PC then auditory system in VR
      - 3DV2DA = Visual system in VR then auditory system on PC 
      - 2DA3DV = Auditory system on PC then visual system in VR
      - 3DA2DV = Auditory system in VR then visual system on PC


SUPPLEMENTAL DATA: 

`Pilot-associations`: stores the data for the Pilot experiment. Columns include: 

`GoodFit-associations`: stores the data for the Goodness-of-fit experiment. Columns include:
